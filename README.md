With a Bachelor's in IT Engineering and an ongoing Master's in Entrepreneurship & Project Management, I've honed my skills at FMIS Cambodia and Optistech, leading Flutter projects that handle sensitive data and complex workflows. My passion lies in bridging technology and business—whether upgrading government apps to reduce approval times or freelancing simple tools with ad integration for passive income. I thrive on mentoring teams and applying agile principles to deliver high-impact, monetizable solutions that solve real problems in Cambodia and beyond.

**Unique Value Proposition (UVP):**  
As a skilled Flutter developer pursuing a Master's in Entrepreneurship & Project Management, I specialize in crafting secure, user-centric mobile apps that drive efficiency and revenue—from government financial systems to freelance monetized tools, all built with agile precision and a focus on scalable innovation.
